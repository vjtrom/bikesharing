# Overview of the Bikesharing Analysis:

This week, students were introduced to Tableau, a power visualization tool used by many commercial and government organizations. Tableau has a GUI front-end (graphical user interface) that allows for dropping and dragging dimensions and measures to create graphs, charts, storyboards, and dashboards. These help the data analyst effectively communicate what the data is telling us. This week’s module incorporates key concepts and skills development including:

- Importing data into Tableau.
- Creating worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
- Using Tableau to make professional looking charts and graphs
- Presenting data in a meaningful and insightful way

Also in this week’s module, the Bikesharing simulation offers a real-world example where you and Kate, your partner in this endeavor, use Tableau to create a powerful data driven story to interested investors.


## Results: 

- Most Bike trips are of a short duration - less than 20 minutes, with most trips being about 5 minutes
- While all genders use the bikesharing program, the highest percentage of riders are Male.
- In looking at peak times by Day of the Week and Hour of the day, most ridership occurs during weekday rush hour.
- This was the case using a sample month of August. As you can see in the graph, the peak times occur during morning and evening rush hour.
- In addition, the rush hour use is highest for all genders.
- When looking at subscribers vs customers, subscribers seem to be using the bikes for communicating during rush hour more than customers (non-subscribers).
- Trip starting locations are concentrated in mid and lower Manhattan.
- Trip ending locations are located in lower, mid and parts of upper Manhattan, as well as Brooklyn.


## Summary:  

The Bikesharing program is mostly used by subscribers for commuting purposes during morning and evening rush hour, with evening rush hour even more popular. All genders follow this pattern, although there are more male riders than female and other genders overall. 

Most of the starting locations begin in lower and midtown Manhattan, while ending locations also include parts of upper Manhattan and Brooklyn. Since there are more offices in lower and midtown Manhattan, and more residences in Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as the fact that the highest peak ridership is in the evening at rush hour, this would suggest that people really like using the Bikesharing program to commute home during weekdays, especially Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. 

One idea is to move more bikes to lower and midtown Manhattan on these evenings so that more people can enjoying using them to commute home, and to avoid any low inventory of bikes in these locations at these times. 

Additional visualizations for future analysis would be:

- how many bikes are available at each location at any given time
- whether there are any shortgages of bikes in any location given demand
